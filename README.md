A collection of image processing scripts with the target of automating image analysis for Petabyte sized datasets

Repo Sub Aim: Stitching for small images and splitting for large images

The repo Contains several collision detection algorithms and annotation quality checkers

Designed to be as flexible as possible, allowing scripts to be integrated across several vision projects, speeding up development time and working as boilerplate code for computer vision applications

datasets used for testing:
instance segmentation:
